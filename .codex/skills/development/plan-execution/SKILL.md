# Work Plan Execution Command

## Overview

Convert a design document and into comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context of our codebase and questionable taste.

Defines the "how" to execute, making sure that the "what" (the design document) is fully understood. Guarantees the successful criteria is correctly defined as well as how the implementation should look like, taking into account best practices and design patterns that must be applied


## The process

**Read Plan and Clarify**
- Read the design document completely
- Review any references or links provided in the plan
- If anything is unclear or ambiguous, use again the `brainstorming` skill to make sure the plan is well laid out
- Get user approval to proceed
- **Do not skip this** - better to ask questions now than build the wrong thing

**Create tasks**
- Break plan into actionable tasks
- Include dependencies between tasks
- Prioritize based on what needs to be done first
- Include testing and quality check tasks
- Keep tasks specific and completable

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Skipping clarifying questions** - Ask now, not after building wrong thing
- **Ignoring plan references** - The plan has links for a reason
